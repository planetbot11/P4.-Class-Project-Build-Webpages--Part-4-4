    <p>
      Exception to the notable buildings in the United Kingdom, you should visit the natural places too to breath clean British air. 
      In the United Kingdom, there are great natual places to visit. This page is especially for the travelers who like to walk in the 
      clean and natural scenery in the UK. 

      Thr first great place I want to introduce is Windsor. This is home to Queen Elizabeth II. It's a town name that is so clean and fresh.
      In there, you can see Windor Castle located in, and you should take picture of that. You also need to taste homemade fudge in Fudge 
      Kitchen. You should take a long walk around Windsor Great Park.

      The second great place I want to introduce is Lake District. It's located in Northen England, and it it recognized by UNESCO Heritage. 
      It's got sixteen lakes whole around the park. You should check to see bigger lake of Windermere. If you want to wee the quiet lake, you 
      need to see Ullswater Lake. If you want to have a night around the great lake scenery, you should book a room in the Langdale Chase Hotel.

      The third great place I want to introduce is Cairngorms. It is located at the north of Scotland. It's considered as one of the most quiet 
      places in the Scotland. You should ride a bike or walk up the hills. When you do that, you will observe unforgettable mememoy in your head. 
      You may see some deers living there too, so don't forget to take a photo of them too.
