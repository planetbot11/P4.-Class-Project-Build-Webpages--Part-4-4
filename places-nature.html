      Exception to the notable buildings in the United Kingdom, you should visit the natural places too to breathe clean British air. 
      In the United Kingdom, there are great natural places to visit. This page is especially for the travelers who like to walk in the 
      clean and natural scenery in the UK. 

      The first great place I want to introduce is Windsor. This is home to Queen Elizabeth II. It's a town name that is so clean and fresh.
      In there, you can see Windsor Castle located in, and you should take a picture of that. You also need to taste homemade fudge in Fudge 
      Kitchen. You should take a long walk around Windsor Great Park.

      The second great place I want to introduce is the Lake District. It's located in Northern England and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
      It's got sixteen lakes whole around the park. You should check out the larger lake, Windermere. If you want to see the quiet lake, you 
      need to see Ullswater Lake. If you want to have a night around the great lake scenery, you should book a room in the Langdale Chase Hotel.

      The third great place I want to introduce is the Cairngorms. It is located in the north of Scotland. It's considered one of the quietest 
      places in Scotland. You should ride a bike or walk up the hills. When you do that, you will create an unforgettable memory. 
      You may see some deer living there, too, so don't forget to take a photo of them, too.
