    <h1 class="mb-4">Notable Buildings to Visit</h1>

    <p>
      In the United Kingdom, there are so many notable buildings that you can visit. The United Kingdom has a long history of buildings. 
      Each building in the United Kingdom attracts many travellers, and most are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
      That means buildings in the United Kingdom are not just made of concrete. The buildings are art.

      The first building I want to introduce to you is Buckingham Palace. It's so easy. "United Kingdom, Buckingham Palace" It should 
      come first to your mind! Buckingham Palace is where the monarch of the United Kingdom resides. It has a long history. It was 
      first inhabited by the monarch King George III. Yes, it's that George III. When the American Revolution occurred, he was the monarch of 
      the United Kingdom. King George III bought a house from the Duke of Buckingham, and he called it Buckingham House at first. Then, it 
      finally became Buckingham Palace. Many monarchs serve national works there.

      The second building I want to introduce to you is Big Ben. It's the clock tower made during the Victorian Era. It's famous for the accuracy
      and the bell. The tower was formally known as St. Stephen's Tower until Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. The clock was designed by 
      Edmund Beckett Denison. It's beautiful, especially at night. It is located right after the Palace of Westminster.

      The third building I want to introduce to you is the Palace of Westminster. It's like the Capitol of the United States. It is located right next to Big 
      Ben, and it is the place where many British politicians work on behalf of the king or queen's rule. It is so beautifully built that the style was in 
      Perpendicular Gothic Revival style. There are the House of Commons and the House of Lords that rule the UK. The people in the House of Commons hold more power than
      the people in the House of Lords. The House of Commons represents like the House of Representatives in the US, and the House of Lords represents like the House of the Senate in the US.
