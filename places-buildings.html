    <h1 class="mb-4">Notable Buildings to Visit</h1>

    <p>
      In the United Kingdom, there are so many notable buildings that you can visit. United Kingdom has the long history of buildings. 
      Each building in the United Kingdom attracts many travelers, and most of the buildings are chosen as UNESCO heritage buildings.
      That means that buildings in the United Kingdom are not just construction of sements. The buildings are arts.

      The first building I want to introduce to you is Buckingham Palace. It's so easy. "United Kingdom, Buckingham Palace" It should 
      come first in your mind! Buckingham Palace is where the monarch of the United Kingdom resides in. It has the long history. It was 
      first resided by the monarch King George III. Yes, it's that George III. When American Revolution occured, he was the monarch of 
      the United Kingdom. King George III bought a house from the Duke of Buckingham, and he called it Buckingham House at first. Then, it 
      finally became Buckingham Palace. Many monarchs serve national works their.

      The second building I want to introduce to you is Big Ben. It's the clock tower made during the Victorian Era. It's famous for the accuracy
      and the bell. The tower was formally known as St. Stephen's Tower until the Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. The clock was designed by 
      Edmund Beckett Denison. It's beautiful, especially, when you observe it at night. It is located right after the Palace of Wesminster.

      The third building I want to introduce to you is Palace of Wesminster. It's like the Capitol of the United States. It is located right next to Big 
      Ben, and it is the place where many British politicians work for behalf of king or queen's rule. It is so beautifully built that the style was in 
      Perpendicular Gothic Revial style. There are House of Commons and House of Lords who rule the UK. The people in House of Commons hold the more power than
      the people in House of Lords. House of Commons represent like House of Representatives in US, and House of Lords represent like House of Senate in US.
