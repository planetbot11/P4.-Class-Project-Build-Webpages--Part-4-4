    <p>
      It's extremely important that you bring the unforgettable memory after you visit the United Kingdom.
      To make that happen to you should buy unforgettable products from the United Kingdom before you live, 
      and this website is here for you to introduce what to buy, so you can consider them.

      First really precious thing that I want to introduce to you is this. You already know it. You should be thinking this 
      if you think UK. Did you get it? You still didn't get it? It's British tea. British tea should absolutely come to your mind
      because if you don't buy British tea, then you can't say you traveled UK. Ha! Ha! Well, I am joking. You should memorize again and 
      have British environment in your home while you drink the British tea. 

      Second merchandise that I want to introduce to you is Burkingham Palace merchanidse. Well, we can easily buy Buckingham Palace 
      products on any locations around the world. However, the product of Buckingham Palace that I am introducing to you is the original product 
      made in the England. It is sold from Buckingham Palace. That's the original real product. After you leave, you will be familar with Royal Family's
      lives by putting the palace model near you.

      Third merchandise that I want to introduce to you is biscuits. Biscuits? If you bought a tea, then you should definitely buy biscuits since they go
      altogether. Drinking British tea without biscuits is like eating hamburger without soda and French Fries. You need taste British foods after you leave
      the United Kingdom.
