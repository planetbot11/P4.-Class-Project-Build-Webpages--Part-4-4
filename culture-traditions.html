    <p>
     The United Kingdom has a long tradition. The United Kingdom is the only country with a monarch representing it.
      In the modern world, a king or queen is not really well-known because monarchs have been gone for a long time. Well, the United Kingdom
      is not technically ruled by a monarch, but it has a monarch who represents the head of state of the country. Have you ever read the statement
      "Reign but not rule"? It means the country is run by its Prime Minister, not by the monarch. The United Kingdom is a country that is so
      particular from any other country that currently exists. Additionally, except for the constitutional monarchy system, the UK has many interesting 
      traditions. In this page, I will introduce some of it. 

      The first tradition I want to introduce is that British people are not really friendly unless they are really close friends. In the 
      In the United States, we usually say normal stuff to strangers well. This is called "small talking." In the UK, they don't have this 
      kind of thing, so they don't hug each other a lot, either. When they meet, they usually prefer to shake hands rather than hug. 

      The second tradition I want to introduce is the Royal Family's life story is the main topic of conversation among the British. As I mentioned above, 
      The United Kingdom is the country that still has a king or queen. Royal Family members' lives are watched by people in the United Kingdom 
      on television. Most British people talk about what the Royal Family members did and where they went every day.
      If you go to the United Kingdom and talk about the Royal Family, you will be welcomed more, so know that before you visit the country.

      The third tradition I want to introduce is that they have tea time every day. In the United Kingdom, tea time is the period when British people
      relax. British people interact socially with friends a lot during tea time. Well, the tea drinking tradition was not originally created in 
      the UK, but it became a widespread culture throughout the United Kingdom. It originated in China, and the United Kingdom influenced the world by making colonies.
      Thus, most countries influenced by the United Kingdom drink tea.
