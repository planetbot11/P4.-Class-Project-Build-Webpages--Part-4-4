    <p>
      The United Kingdom has a so long tradition. The United Kingdom is the country that still has its monarch representing country.
      In the modern world, king or queen is not really a well-known thing because monarch had gone a long time. Well, the United Kingdom
      is not technically ruled by monarch, but it has monarch that's representing head of state of the country. Have you ever read the statement
      "reign but not rule"? It means that the country is run by their Prime Minister and not by the monarch. United Kingdom is the country that is so
      particular from any other countries currently exist. Additionally, except the constitutional monarchy system, the UK has many interesting 
      traditions. In this page, I will introduce some of it. 

      The first tradition I want to introduce is British people are not really freidnly unless there are really close friends to them. In the 
      United States, we usually say normal stuff with the unknown people well. This is called as "small talking." In UK, they don't have this 
      kind of thing, so they don't hug each other a lot, too. When they usually meet they rather shake hands than hug. 

      The second tradition I want to introduce is Royal Family's life story is the main topic of conversation to British. As I mentioned above, 
      United Kingdom is the country that still has the king or queen. Royal Family members' lives are watched by people in the United Kingdom 
      through television. Most British people usually talk on what the Royal Family members did today, and where thay went today on every day.
      If you go United Kingdom and talk about Royal Family, they will be welcoming you more, so know that before you visit the country.

      The third tradition I want to introduce is they have tea time every day. In the United Kingdom, tea time is the period that British people
      relax. British people socially interact with other friends a lot through tea time. Well, tea drinking tradition was not originally created in 
      the UK, but it became widespread culture through United Kingdom. It was originated China, and United Kingdom influenced the world by making colonies.
      Thus, most countries in the world influenced by United Kingdom drink teas.
